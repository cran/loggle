\title{A function to learn time-varying graphical models using cv.vote}

\description{
This function is to efficiently learn time-varying graphical models for a given set of tuning parameters. Different from \link{loggle}, cv.vote is also applied in estimating time-varying graphs.
}

\usage{
loggle.cv.vote(X, pos = 1:ncol(X), 
h = 0.8*ncol(X)^(-1/5), d = 0.2, lambda = 0.25, 
cv.fold = 5, fit.type = "pseudo", refit = TRUE, 
cv.vote.thres = 0.8, epi.abs = 1e-5, epi.rel = 1e-3, 
max.step = 500, detrend = TRUE, fit.corr = TRUE, 
num.thread = 1, print.detail = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{X}{a p by N data matrix containing observations on a time grid ranging from 0 to 1: p -- number of variables, N -- number of time points. The nominal time for the kth time point is (k-1)/(N-1)}
  \item{pos}{a vector constitutes a subset of \{1, 2, ..., N\}: indices of time points where graphs are estimated, default = 1:N}
  \item{h}{a scalar between 0 and 1: bandwidth in kernel smoothed sample covariance/correlation matrix, default = 0.8*N^(-1/5)}
  \item{d}{a scalar or a vector of the same length as \code{pos} with values between 0 and 1: width of neighborhood centered at each time point specified by \code{pos}, default = 0.2}
  \item{lambda}{a scalar or a vector of the same length as \code{pos}: tuning parameter of lasso penalty at each time point specified by \code{pos}, default = 0.25}
  \item{cv.fold}{a scalar: number of cross-validation folds, default = 5}
  \item{fit.type}{a string: "likelihood" -- likelihood estimation, "pseudo" -- pseudo likelihood estimation, or "space" -- sparse partial correlation estimation, default = "pseudo"}
  \item{refit}{logic: if TRUE, conduct model refitting given learned graph structures, default = TRUE}
  \item{cv.vote.thres}{a scalar between 0 and 1: an edge is kept after cv.vote if and only if it exists in no less than \code{cv.vote.thres}*\code{cv.fold} cv folds, default = 0.8}
  \item{epi.abs}{a scalar: absolute tolerance in ADMM stopping criterion, default = 1e-5}
  \item{epi.rel}{a scalar: relative tolerance in ADMM stopping criterion, default = 1e-3}
  \item{max.step}{an integer: maximum iteration steps in ADMM iteration, default = 500}
  \item{detrend}{logic: if TRUE, subtract kernel weighted moving average for each variable in data matrix (i.e., detrending), if FALSE, subtract overall average for each variable in data matrix (i.e., centering), default = TRUE}
  \item{fit.corr}{logic: if TRUE, use sample correlation matrix in model fitting, if FALSE, use sample covariance matrix in model fitting, default = TRUE}
  \item{num.thread}{an integer: number of threads used in parallel computing, default = 1}
  \item{print.detail}{logic: if TRUE, print details in model fitting procedure, default = TRUE}
}
  
\details{
The idea of cross-validation is implemented in this function, where \link{loggle} is applied on each cross-validation fold to get fold-wise estimated time-varying graphs, and cv.vote is then applied across cross-validation folds to get the final version of estimated time-varying graphs.

The model fitting method based on pseudo-likelihood (\code{fit.type = "pseudo"} or \code{fit.type = "space"}) is usually less computationally intensive than that based on likelihood (\code{fit.type = "likelihood"}), with similar model fitting performance.

\code{cv.vote.thres} controls the tradeoff between false discovery rate and power. A large value of \code{cv.vote.thres} would decrease false discovery rate but also hurt power.

If no pre-processing has been done to the data matrix \code{X}, \code{detrend = TRUE} is recommended to detrend each variable in data matrix by subtracting corresponding kernel weighted moving average.

\code{fit.corr = TRUE} is recommended such that all the variables are of the same scale. If \code{fit.corr = FALSE} is used, the default value of \code{lambda} may need to be changed accordingly.
